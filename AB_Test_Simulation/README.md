# A/B Test Simulation: Treatment Effect Evaluation

This simulation models a **controlled A/B test** to evaluate the effect of a treatment intervention on a continuous outcome metric.  
The outcome can represent performance indicators such as **revenue, engagement time, or conversions**, scaled by participants‚Äô baseline activity levels.

---

## Experiment Overview

- **Control group**: baseline users without treatment  
- **Treatment group**: users exposed to the new intervention  
- **Metric**: continuous (e.g., spend, time, or count), influenced by baseline activity  
- **Goal**: estimate the treatment lift and assess statistical significance

---

## Statistical Methods

1. **Welch‚Äôs t-test** ‚Äî compares mean outcomes between groups without controlling for baseline differences.  
2. **Adjusted regression model** ‚Äî controls for baseline performance to isolate the true treatment effect.

## Results Summary

| Model | Estimate (Treatment Lift) | SE | Test Statistic | *p*-value | 95% CI | Effect Size (Cohen‚Äôs *d*) |
|:------|---------------------------:|--:|---------------:|-----------:|-------:|---------------------------:|
| Welch‚Äôs t-test | 10.21 | ‚Äì | 2.98 | 0.0029 | [4.84, 17.51] | 0.18 (small) |
| Adjusted model | **10.12** | 0.16 | 63.89 | < 0.001 | ‚Äì | ‚Äì |

> The adjusted model more accurately captures the true lift (**‚âà10.12 units**) by accounting for baseline variability,  
> while the t-test provides a simpler but less precise estimate.

---

## Interpretation

- The treatment group achieved a **significant performance increase** over control.  
- Adjusting for baseline improves accuracy and interpretability of the estimated lift.  
- The small Cohen‚Äôs *d* suggests the lift is statistically significant but modest in magnitude.
