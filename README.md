### 5. [Loan Default Risk Prediction](./loan-default-risk-prediction)
![Feature Importance Plot](./loan-default-risk-prediction/FeatureImportance-RandomForest.jpg)
This project tackles the Kaggle “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques” competition by predicting house sale prices using 1,460 training samples and 80 features. Base models **RidgeCV, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting** are assessed via cross-validation and log-RMSE, then ensembled in a **Stacking Regressor**. Feature importance scores underscore quality ratings, property size, and neighborhood prices as primary predictors of house prices.
