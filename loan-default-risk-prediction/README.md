# Loan Default Risk Prediction
This notebook presents an optimized workflow for building a model that predicts the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans using customer data. By identifying high-risk applicants early, financial institutions can make informed lending decisions, reduce credit losses, and optimize portfolio performance.
